### caching 
- there's no point converting the whole scene when sending to the view
  

### folder structure
- ./project -> root directory
- ./project/data.json  -> the project file
- ./project/panoramas -> the panorama images
- ./project/photos
- ./project/articles

TODO: 
- maybe store the writer and not close the file at save, for save function
- maybe have the project check if the store changed, and make a save reminder, auto save etc.
